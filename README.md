_Keep track of your inventory of 3D-printer filament spools._

Spoolman is a self-hosted web service designed to help you efficiently manage your 3D printer filament spools and monitor their usage. It acts as a centralized database that seamlessly integrates with popular 3D printing software like [OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org/) and [Klipper](https://www.klipper3d.org/)/[Moonraker](https://moonraker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). When connected, it automatically updates spool weights as printing progresses, giving you real-time insights into filament usage.

### Features
* **Filament Management**: Keep comprehensive records of filament types, manufacturers, and individual spools.
* **API Integration**: The [REST API](https://donkie.github.io/Spoolman/) allows easy integration with other software, facilitating automated workflows and data exchange.
* **Real-Time Updates**: Stay informed with live spool updates through Websockets, providing immediate feedback during printing operations.
* **Web-Based Client**: Spoolman includes a built-in web client that lets you manage data effortlessly:
  * View, create, edit, and delete filament data.
  * Add custom fields to tailor information to your specific needs.
  * Print labels with QR codes for easy spool identification and tracking.
  * Contribute to its translation into 18 languages via [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/spoolman/).
* **Database Support**: SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and CockroachDB.
* **Multi-Printer Management**: Handles spool updates from several printers simultaneously.
* **Advanced Monitoring**: Integrate with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) for detailed historical analysis of filament usage, helping you track and optimize your printing processes.

**Integrations:**
  * [Moonraker](https://moonraker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/#spoolman) and most front-ends (Fluidd, KlipperScreen, Mainsail, ...)
  * [OctoPrint](https://github.com/mdziekon/octoprint-spoolman)
  * [OctoEverywhere](https://octoeverywhere.com/spoolman?source=github_spoolman)
  * [Homeassistant](https://github.com/Disane87/spoolman-homeassistant)

## Installation
Spoolman can be installed in two ways, either using **Docker** or **standalone** on your machine.
* The Docker method can be used on any OS which supports Docker.
* The standalone method requires a Debian (e.g. Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi OS) or Arch-based Linux distribution.
  * If you know what you're doing you can also install it standalone for any OS such as Windows, but there are no provided scripts for automated installation, follow the "Install from Source" instructions below.

Docker is the recommended installation method since it is more reliable and portable.

Spoolman comes with a built-in SQLite database that is used by default and will suit most users needs. The data is stored in a single .db file in the server's user directory. You can optionally instead use a PostgreSQL, MySQL or CockroachDB database.

### Docker Install
#### First install
Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in "containers". Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-contained environments that can run on any machine with Docker installed. The Spoolman docker image contains everything it needs to run, so you don't need to worry about for example what Python version you have installed on your local machine.

To install Docker on your machine, follow the instructions for your operating system on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). Docker also includes the docker-compose tool which lets you configure the container deployment in a simple yaml file, without having to remember all the command line options. Note: older versions of docker-compose require you to have a dash (`-`) in the following commands, like `docker-compose` instead of `docker compose`.

Here is a sample docker-compose config to get you started. Create a folder called `spoolman` in your home directory, CD in to it, copy-paste the below sample into a file called `docker-compose.yml` in the new directory and run `docker compose up -d` to start it. If you want to use the SQLite database as in this sample, you must first create a folder called `data` in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml`, then you should run `chown 1000:1000 data` on it in order to give it the correct permissions for the user inside the docker container.
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  spoolman:
    image: ghcr.io/donkie/spoolman:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      # Mount the host machine's ./data directory into the container's /home/app/.local/share/spoolman directory
      - type: bind
        source: ./data # This is where the data will be stored locally. Could also be set to for example `source: /home/pi/printer_data/spoolman`.
        target: /home/app/.local/share/spoolman # Do NOT modify this line
    ports:
      # Map the host machine's port 7912 to the container's port 8000
      - "7912:8000"
    environment:
      - TZ=Europe/Stockholm # Optional, defaults to UTC
```
Once you have it up and running, you can access the web UI by browsing to `http://server.ip:7912`. *Make sure that the data folder you created now contains a `spoolman.db` file*. If you cannot find this file in your machine, then **your data will be lost** every time you update Spoolman.

Type `docker compose logs` in the terminal to see the server logs.

If you want to modify things like database connection, add environment variables to the `environment:` section of the `docker-compose.yml` like shown in the sample above and then restart the service: `docker compose restart`. See the `.env.example` file for a list of all environment variables you can use.

#### Updating
If a new version of Spoolman has been released, you can update to it by first browsing to the directory where you have the `docker-compose.yml` file and then running `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`.

### Standalone Install
#### First install
This installation method assumes you are using a Debian-based Linux distribution such as Ubuntu or Raspberry Pi OS. If you are using Arch, or any other distribution, please modify as appropriate.

Make sure your current directory is in your logged in user's home directory. Copy-paste the entire below command and run it on your machine to install the latest release of Spoolman.
```bash
sudo apt-get update && \
sudo apt-get install -y curl jq && \
mkdir -p ./Spoolman && \
source_url=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/Donkie/Spoolman/releases/latest | jq -r '.assets[] | select(.name == "spoolman.zip").browser_download_url') && \
curl -sSL $source_url -o temp.zip && unzip temp.zip -d ./Spoolman && rm temp.zip && \
cd ./Spoolman && \
bash ./scripts/install.sh
```

If you want to modify things like database connection, edit the `.env` file in the `Spoolman` folder and restart the service.

#### Updating
Updating Spoolman is quite simple. If you use the default database type, SQLite, it is stored outside of the installation folder (in `~/.local/share/spoolman`), so you will not lose any data by moving to a new installation folder.

Copy-paste the entire below commands and run it on your machine to update Spoolman to the latest version. The command assumes your existing Spoolman folder is named `Spoolman` and is located in your current directory.
```bash
# Stop and disable the old Spoolman service
sudo systemctl stop Spoolman
sudo systemctl disable Spoolman
systemctl --user stop Spoolman
systemctl --user disable Spoolman

# Download and install the new version
mv Spoolman Spoolman_old && \
mkdir -p ./Spoolman && \
source_url=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/Donkie/Spoolman/releases/latest | jq -r '.assets[] | select(.name == "spoolman.zip").browser_download_url') && \
curl -sSL $source_url -o temp.zip && unzip temp.zip -d ./Spoolman && rm temp.zip && \
cp Spoolman_old/.env Spoolman/.env && \
cd ./Spoolman && \
bash ./scripts/install.sh && \
rm -rf ../Spoolman_old
```

### Using Docker
You can also run Spoolman using Docker. Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-contained environments that can run on any machine with Docker installed.

To install Docker on your machine, follow the instructions for your operating system on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

#### Updating
If a new version of Spoolman has been released, you can update to it by first browsing to the directory where you have the `docker-compose.yml` file and then running `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`.

### Environment variables
These are either set in the .env file if you use the standalone installation, or in the docker-compose.yml if you use Docker.

If you want to connect with an external database instead, specify the `SPOOLMAN_DB_*` environment variables from the table below.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
### QR Code Does not work on HTTP / The page is not served over HTTPS
This is a limitation of the browsers. Browsers require a secure connection to the server to enable HTTPS. This is not a limitation of Spoolman. For more information read this [blog](https://blog.mozilla.org/webrtc/camera-microphone-require-https-in-firefox-68/) from Mozilla.

[OctoEverywhere.com](https://octoeverywhere.com/spoolman?source=github_spoolman_qr) is An easy way to get secure HTTPS access to Spoolman. Remote access with OctoEverywhere is always secure and easier than setting up a reverse proxy + SSL self-signed certificate.

Another option is to put Spoolman behind a reverse proxy like Caddy or Nginx to enable HTTPS. See for example [this guide](https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/reverse-proxy) for Caddy.

### Can Spoolman be translated into my language?
Yes, head over to [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/spoolman/) to start the translation!

## Install from source
**Advanced users only.**

If you want to run the absolute latest version of Spoolman, you can either use the `edge` tagged Docker image, or follow
these steps to install from source. Keep in mind that this is straight from the master branch which may contain unfinished and untested features. You may also not be able to go back to a previous version since the database schema may change.

1. Make sure you have at least NodeJS 20 or higher installed, and Python 3.9 or higher installed.
1. Clone this repo or download the zip source.
2. Inside the `client/` folder:
   1. Create a .env file with `VITE_APIURL=/api/v1` in it
   2. Run `npm ci`
   3. Run `npm run build`
4. Install PDM using `pip install --user pdm`
5. Build the requirements.txt file: `pdm export -o requirements.txt --without-hashes > requirements.txt`
3. Give scripts permissions: `chmod +x ./scripts/*.sh`
6. Run the installer script like the normal install: `./scripts/install.sh`

## Development
### Server/Backend (Python)
The Python backend is built using Python 3.9 standards. It's built on FastAPI for the REST API, and SQLAlchemy to handle the databases.

To setup yourself for Python development, do the following:
1. Clone this repo
2. CD into the repo
3. Install PDM: `pip install --user pdm`
4. Install Spoolman dependencies: `pdm sync`

And you should be all setup. Read the Style and Integration Testing sections below as well.

#### Style
[Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) is used to ensure a consistent style and good code quality. You can install extensions in your editor to make them run automatically.

[Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is used to ensure the style is maintained for each commit. You can setup pre-commit by simply running the following in the Spoolman root directory:
```
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

#### Integration Testing
The entire backend is integration tested using an isolated docker container, with all 4 database types that we support (Postgres, MySQL, SQLite and CockroachDB). These integration tests live in `tests_integration/`. They are designed to "use" the REST API in the same way that a client would, and ensures that everything remains consistent between updates. The databases are created as part of the integration testing, so no external database is needed to run them.

If you have docker installed, you can run the integration tests using `pdm run itest` for all databases, or e.g. `pdm run itest postgres` for a single database.


### Client (Node/React/Typescript)
The client is a React-based web client, built using the [refine.dev](https://refine.dev) framework, with Ant Design as the components.

To test out changes to the web client, the best way is to run it in development mode.

Prerequisites:
* NodeJS 20 or above installed, along with NPM. Running `node --version` should print a correct version.
* A running Spoolman server, with the following two environment variables added in the `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
    environment:
      - FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS=*
      - SPOOLMAN_DEBUG_MODE=TRUE
```

Instructions:
1. Open a terminal and CD to the `client` subdirectory
2. Run `npm install`. If it doesn't succeed, you probably have an incorrect node version. Spoolman is only tested on NodeJS 20.
3. Run `echo "VITE_APIURL=http://192.168.0.123:7901/api/v1" > .env`, where the ip:port is the address of the running Spoolman server. This should create a `.env` file in the `client` directory. If you don't already have one running on your network, you can start one up using the `docker-compose.yml` showed above.
4. Run `npm run dev`. The terminal will print a "Local: xxxx" URL, open that in your browser and the web client should show up. Your existing spools etc in your Spoolman database should be loaded in.
5. Any edits in .ts/.tsx files will be automatically reloaded in your browser. If you make any change to .json files you will need to F5 in your browser.
